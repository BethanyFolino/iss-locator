# ISS Locator
ISS Locator is a Python program that includes functions that gather info from the International Space Station's API and print it out for you.

The first function gathers a list of the astronauts currently in space, and it prints the total number of astronauts in space, their full names, and the spacecraft they are currently on board.

The second function obtains the ISS's current location and prints out its current geographic coordinates in
latitude and longitude along with a timestamp.

The third function uses ISS API data to determine the next time the ISS will be overhead of Indianapolis, Indiana, and it prints the next passover time.

I made this program as part of Kenzie Academy's software engineering program.
